# BrainspanCorrelation
R script for calculating Gene expression correlation using Brainspan expression dataset

I do not claim to be the best R coder at all, i just hope people with limited R skills can use this script. It should be rather straightforward - script for figures probably need some finetuning for personal preferences.
